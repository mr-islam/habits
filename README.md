## Intro
Looks like this is SwitftUI, since the reference in xcode opens the `SwiftUICore` docs.


## New Plans
### Core
- [ ] Notifications for habits
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Compare to Loop and see core features that are necessary
- [ ] Set it to be 5 days on portait
- [ ] Support landscape with extra days displayed (or maybe make the number of day a dynamic thing based on screen size)

### Later
- [ ] Add filters for the habits (archived or not, not done today or not)
- [ ] Make the Main title "Habits" nicer
- [ ]

### Really later
- [ ] Support archiving habits
- [ ] 

## Completed
- [x] Update README
- [x] Confirm if this is UIKit or SwiftUI
- [x] Fix the dates newline on main screen
